Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.


### ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package manager)
- [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (recommended)

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/StephEngl/Coderr.git
    cd Coderr
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```sh
    python -m venv env

    ```

7. **If your frontend uses guest users, create one for business and customer user in the admin panel:**

        - Email: `business.guest@coderr.de`
        - Password: `321Coderr987+`
    - Create a customer user with:
        - Username: `GuestCustomer`
        - Email: `customer.guest@coderr.de`
        - Password: `321Coderr987+`
          
    > **Note:** Don't forget to add the Guest user information to your frontend configuration so it can authenticate as the guest user.
